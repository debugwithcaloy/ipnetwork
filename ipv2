echo "The IP address 127.0.0.1 with the subnet mask 8 (written as 127.0.0.1/8) is a loopback address commonly referred to as "localhost."

In IP networking, the loopback address (127.0.0.1) is used to refer to the local computer itself. It is often used for testing network connections and services on the local machine without actually involving any external networks.

The /8 subnet mask indicates that the first 8 bits of the IP address (127.0.0.1) represent the network portion, leaving the remaining bits for host addressing within the local loopback network. Essentially, it means that only the first octet (127) is significant for identifying the network, while the remaining three octets (0.0.1) are available for host addressing within the loopback network."
